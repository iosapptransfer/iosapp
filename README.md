Hi there.



My name is Meng Du, I need to buy apps that are already approved on the AppStore. Any kind, any functionality, any complexity is welcome, and no limitation in quantity.



 The following are specific requirements:

1. it must be approved and can be searched from AppStore
2. it must has code, please make sure that can be compiled successfully
3. it must has NO IAP
4. if it needs server side, please guarantee we can access that for over three month
5. the latest upgrade date must be later than 2019.1.1, please submit a new version for any older one
6. the latest version must NOT rejected, please submit a new version until no rejection
7. it must be supported in China Market



Please NOTE, what I need is the OWNERSHIP of the App, that means you have to transfer the ownership to my account in this way

Before each transaction, please provide these documents first

1. A txt file of the AppStore url list for all apps you plan to transfer

2. Provide two screenshots for each app:
   1. screenshot of iTunesConnect

      ![AppStoreVersions](./img/AppStoreVersions.png)

   2. screenshot of Xcode and Simulator for project and app

      ![Xcode](./img/Xcode.png)



I hope we can have a long tern cooperation. But for our first transaction, we need to proceed in the following order

1. you transfer the app to us

2. I pay half of price to you

3. you send me the code

4. I pay the rest of price to you

After first transaction, any way is fine.

 

My budget will be 150$ at least for each, if you have any app matches all the requirements and price, please contact me.
